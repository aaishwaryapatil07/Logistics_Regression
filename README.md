# Logistics_Regression

Logistic regression is a statistical method for analyzing a dataset in which there are one or more independent variables that determine an outcome. The outcome is measured with a dichotomous variable (in which there are only two possible outcomes)

Note: Logistics Regression is only used when the data is linearly seperable and when the label can be categorised.
